          <h1>WHAT ARE THE BEAR BUMS?</h1>
          <p>
            The Bear Bums are an NFT Collectible series. There are 5,000 of them
            that were uniquely and programmatically generated with over 350+
            variations, accessories, and personality traits.
            <br />
            The Bear Bums overall will become a foundational community within
            the blockchain itself. Although, they are an NFT collectible, these
            bears are much more than just a character, they are an entire NFT
            journey and experience within the metaverse they call home.

              We give our Bear Bums a home in the form of our Website and social
              channel launches. The bears are then revealed, and two are even
              given new homes, as we begin to build awareness of this bear army.

              Five more bears are adopted while the rest get ready to party on
              Opensea. To celebrate, we begin rebuilding the bear’s natural
              habitat by planting a tree for every bear sold or resold for the
              entirety of their existence! Our goal is to plant 1,000,000+
              trees! The first press release on the Bear Bums hits the NFT
              media, and the community goes wild when we do a surprise air drop
              of a rare bear…

              It’s time for the rare bears to stop being so shy and reveal
              themselves! The community gets to meet these creatures that have
              been hiding, and find them now on Opensea. We introdce our Honey
              Points and its incentives to the community. Sold over 2,000 Bears
              and we begin planting trees right away!

              The Bear Bums wake their community out of hibernation by dropping
              some major bombs. Details of their animated series come to light,
              and a major announcement is made. From this point on there will be
              heavy rewards and community incentives. You may actually get tired
